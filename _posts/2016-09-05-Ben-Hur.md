Formerly British schooner M.C. Upper Built in 1874 at Dunville, Ont., she was a 314t wooden schooner barge purchased by Murphy Wrecking to attempt the salvage of the schooner TREMBLE. During the attempted salvage, she was struck by the passing schooner barge SUPERIOR in tow of the vessel PASSAIC. She went down near the TREMBLE taking the cable tending scow with her.

### The Dive

Located on the U.S. side just South of the Blue Water Bridge at a depth of 60-65 ft. The (3) wrecks are near each other with a majority of the Tremble's hull still intact and closer to the center of the river. A common entry point is approx. 150 ft. North of the range marker. For an alternate entry point see "International Scout" below. Climb over railing fully equipped and go right to the bottom upon entry. head out perpendicular to the seawall and the current should take you downstream to the wreckage. Start your return early with about 2/3 of air supply remaining. Use one of the ladders in the seawall for your exit. Be careful of disorientation with the turbulent waters. With a swift current, this is definitely a dive site for the Upper Advanced.
