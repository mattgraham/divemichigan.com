Built in 1874 by Gibson, Suamico, WI as a 693 ton, wooden, 3 mast grain schooner, she was lost on September 7, 1890. While loaded with coal in up-bound tow of the vessel B.W. BLANCHARD, the down bound freighter W.L. WETMORE collided with her. She sank quickly with (1) loss of life. The rest of her crew were picked up from her yawl by the car ferry HURON.  Located just West of the shipping channel, her bow section has been dynamited because it was considered a navigational hazard. Much of her hull is still intact though broken open. A large amount of the coal she was loaded with still lies in the center of her hull.

### Dive Details

Located on the U.S. side just South of the Blue Water Bridge at a depth of 60-65 ft. The (3) wrecks are near each other with a majority of the Tremble's hull still intact and closer to the center of the river. A common entry point is approx. 150 ft. North of the range marker. For an alternate entry point see "International Scout" below. Climb over railing fully equipped and go right to the bottom upon entry. head out perpendicular to the seawall and the current should take you downstream to the wreckage. Start your return early with about 2/3 of air supply remaining. Use one of the ladders in the seawall for your exit. Be careful of disorientation with the turbulent waters. With a swift current, this is definitely a dive site for the Upper Advanced.
